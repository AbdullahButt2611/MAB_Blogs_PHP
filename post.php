            The Administrative Panel (Irish: An Rolla Riaracháin) is one of five vocational panels which together elect 43 of the 60 members of Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Oireachtas (the legislature of Ireland). The Administrative Panel elects seven senators. Article 18 of the Constitution of Ireland provides that 43 of the 60 senators are to be elected from five vocational panels. The Administrative Panel is defined in Article 18.7.1º(v) as "Public Administration and social services, including voluntary social activities".[1] The Seanad returning officer maintains a list of nominating bodies for each of the five panels.[2] Candidates may be nominated either by four members of the Oireachtas or by a nominating body.[3][4] The electorate consists of city and county councillors and current members of the Oireachtas. As the Seanad election takes place after the election to the Dáil, the Oireachtas members are the members of the incoming Dáil and the outgoing Seanad.[5] Seven senators are elected on the Administrative Panel, at least three of whom must have been nominated by Oireachtas members and at least three must have been nominated by nominating bodies.[6][7]
